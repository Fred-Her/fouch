 * DEMO / DEVELOPMENT DATA — NOT the official Miss Universe 2026 lineup.

 * is not yet finalized/confirmed by the organization at the time of
 * writing. Rather than invent an official-looking roster, this is a
 * clearly-marked demo set of real countries, used only to test the
 * Top 10 mechanic. See `getParticipantsForEvent`'s returned `status`
 * field — the UI must surface "Demo participant data" whenever it is
 * "demo", and this must never be presented as the official lineup.
